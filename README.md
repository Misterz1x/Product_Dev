This is a project for the Product Development, Testing and Approval course. 

The project uses the YOLO pose model to analyze a persons gait and keypoints for knee and hip range of motion. We will compare the keypoint detection to the OpenCap 3D camera system to validate if the out of the box pose-model gives us comaprable results.

The project uses uv as a package manager. 
After cloning the repository and installing the uv manager, using the command 'uv install', the project will be initialized and the needed packages will be installed.
