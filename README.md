This is a project for the Product Development, Testing and Approval cousre. 

The project uses the YOLO pose model to analyze a persons gait and keypoints for knee range of motion. We will compare the keypoint detection to the open pose 3D camera system to validate either methods as a valid alternative to tedious human analyzes of knee RoM of injured knees, while wearing a knee brace for stabilization.

The project uses uv as a package manager. 
After cloning the repository and the uv manager, using the command uv install, the project will be initialized and the needed packages will be installed.
